## 🔧 Common Questions

**A:** No! That's why you run `prepare-for-sharing` - it removes it. The recipient's `start.bat` will install it automatically.

### Q: What if they don't have Node.js?
**A:** The `start.bat` script will tell them to install it from nodejs.org

### Q: Can they edit the code?
**A:** Yes! Once they have it running, they can edit any files and see changes immediately.

### Q: Will it work on their computer?
**A:** As long as they have Node.js v18+, yes! The app is designed to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Q: What if port 8080 is busy?
**A:** They can edit `vite.config.ts` and change the port, or the error message will guide them.
